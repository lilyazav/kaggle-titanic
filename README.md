Creating a model to predict who survived the Titanic wreck.

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

For my first submission:

1. I imputed NAs by using the mean for numeric vars and mode for non-numeric vars.
2. I used a logistical regression model with hyperparameters determined (penalty = 0.0000000001, mixture = 0.333)

My submission had 76.8% accuracy in predicting Titanic survival rates.
